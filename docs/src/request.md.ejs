## request

`request(command: string, options: object): Promise<object>`

Returns the response from invoking the specified command, with the specified options, on the connected divvyd server.

Refer to [divvyd APIs](https://xdv.io/build/divvyd-apis/) for commands and options. All XDV amounts must be specified in drops. One drop is equal to 0.000001 XDV. See [Specifying Currency Amounts](https://divvy.com/build/divvyd-apis/#specifying-currency-amounts).

Most commands return data for the `current` (in-progress, open) ledger by default. Do not rely on this. Always specify a ledger version in your request. In the example below, the 'validated' ledger is requested, which is the most recent ledger that has been validated by the whole network. See [Specifying Ledgers](https://divvy.com/build/divvyd-apis/#specifying-ledgers).

### Return Value

This method returns a promise that resolves with the response from divvyd.

### Example

```javascript
// Replace 'ledger' with your desired divvyd command
return api.request('ledger', {
  ledger_index: 'validated'
}).then(response => {
  /* Do something useful with response */
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response, null, 2))
}).catch(console.error);
```
